# 🎯 Key Insights:

- Sales Department has the highest attrition (56.12%), followed by HR (38.82%) and R&D (5.06%).
- Younger employees (ages 27–33) represent the largest group and also show higher attrition, especially those under 30.
- Males (150) have higher attrition numbers than females (87), but this varies across age groups.
- Job roles with high attrition include Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician, while roles like Manager and Research Director show better retention.
- Education Field Influence: Employees with a Life Sciences or Medical background exhibit higher attrition compared to other fields.
- Job Satisfaction Impact: Lower satisfaction scores (1 or 2) are associated with higher attrition in job roles like Sales Executive and Lab Technician.
- Employees aged 25–34 make up the bulk of attrition (112 out of 237), suggesting the need for engagement strategies in this age group.
